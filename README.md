# Card War Game

This Python program simulates the classic card game "War" between two players. The game involves comparing the values of cards to determine the winner of each round. If the values match, a "war" occurs where additional cards are drawn

# Features

-   Deck Creation: Generates a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
-   Shuffling: Randomly shuffles the deck to ensure fairness.
-   Gameplay Logic: Implements the rules of the "War" card game, including comparisons, wars, and handling of player decks.
-   Player Interaction: Allows players to compete against each other until one player runs out of cards.
